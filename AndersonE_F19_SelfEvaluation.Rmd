<p>The following self evaluation is meant to guide you through a
reflection on what you put into this course, and also what you got out
of it in return. Your self evaluation is <em>not</em> the place to
criticize, evaluate, or thank the instructor (we will have had many
thorough conversations about that in class, and formal evaluations on
the last day of class). This is about <em>you</em>. Unless otherwise
noted, please answer each question in no more than <em>eight</em>
sentences. At the end, I ask you to assign yourself a grade that you
think is both a fair and honest reflection of your performance in the
class given what was asked of you. <br><br> Whether I agree with your
assessment or not, I will schedule a time for us to discuss your
self-assessment. In this discussion, we will come to an agreement
regarding your final grade reflecting the criteria in the <a
href="https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/overview.html">Course
Overview</a> and as outlined below.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<hr />
<p>Please download this Markdown file (<code>selfevaluation.Rmd</code>)
from my GitHub site (in the
<code>fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/</code> folder) and answer the
appropriate questions in the spaces provided. Once you’ve knitted the
final file, please <em>email</em> the <strong>html</strong> version of
that file to me with the name
<code>[LastF]_F19_SelfEvaluation.html</code> (with <code>LastF</code>
meaning your last name followed by your first initial, i.e., mine would
be called <code>SchmittC_F19_SelfEvaluation.html</code>). I must receive
this file by <strong>December 14, 2023</strong> at the earliest, and by
<strong>Midnight of the Final Exam Date</strong> at the latest.</p>

<h3>Overall Impression</h3>
<hr />
<p>In place of my name as author on this Markdown file, please insert
your own, along with the date on which you completed this
self-assessment. In place of the RuPaul GIF, above, please choose a GIF
of a drag queen that best exemplifies your overall feelings about what
you learned/accomplished in this course. Additionally, replace the
<code>The following self evaluation...</code> text below your GIF with a
three sentence summary of your experience in the class and what you take
away from it to accompany that GIF. You may also choose a catchy
title.</p>

<h3>What were you asked to do?</h3>

<p>Please give me a bulleted/numbered list of each task you were asked
to do for this course. Where relevant, please also link the
<em>html</em> version of the file representing each task, in your own
repos, to the bulleted entry for that task.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr />
Modules 1-22 including student-led modules
All five homework assignments and peer feedback
<br>
file:///Users/erin/AN588/AN-588-Week-2/Module-4.html
<br>
This was my first homework! I didn't know about chunks and how to organuze my code in R at this point and can visibly see the difference between that assignment and the work I've done at the end of the semester.
<br>
file:///Users/erin/AN588/Homework_2/erinea_OriginalHomeworkCode_02.html
<br>
This was homework 2! Looking back at these I feel really good about how much I have progressed even just within the few weeks between these assignments
<br>
file:///Users/erin/AN588/AN588_Zombies_erinea/Homework_3.html
<br>
Homework 3! This one was my favorite. I felt like I was really able to apply the skills we had been working on in class and I had been practicing in the modules. It was really fun to make all the graphs and was rewarding to see it all come together.
<br>


Replication Assignment
<br>
Statistical vignette
<br>
Attended all classes

</div>
<div id="what-did-you-accomplish" class="section level3">
<h3>What did you accomplish?</h3>
<hr />
<p>Please let me know how many of the above tasks you accomplished. If
any of them were accomplished later than stipulated, please note that.
If you contacted me about them being late (and we discussed it and I
said it was ok), please note that, too. You may provide a
bulleted/numbered list matching the one
above.

I completed all homework assignments on time. 
<br>
Two modules were done later than asked as I had not completed them fully and originally had old modules organized in a different way than I do now. 
<br>
My vignette was completed and presented on time, and I turned in my replication assignment on time and followed all deadlines as requested.
<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr />

</div>
<div id="how-well-did-you-accomplish-them" class="section level3">
<h3>How well did you accomplish them?</h3>
<hr />
<p>Please let me know how well you feel you accomplished your tasks, in
a general sense. What do you feel you did the best, and what did you do
the least well? What was the hardest part for you? Did your
work/understanding/ease improve over the course of the
semester?

I am very proud of my replication assignment, Zombies homework, and vignette. I felt that on both of these assignments I put a lot of work into my code and spent a considerable amount of time outside of class and office hours working to make my assignments work well and look nice.

I think I did the malfunction assignment the worst as I had a really hard time figuring the code out and working through the errors I was recieving.

I struggled the most with the replication assignment and with the later modules on GLMMs. I found LMM and GLMMs conceptually challenging and difficult to replicate, as well as work through in my replication assignment. I also had trouble understanding and choosing which models to run for my replication assignment.

class="section level3">
<h3>How has your understanding of and approach to statistics and project
design changed since taking this course?</h3>
<hr />
<p>This may be in relation to previous knowledge, or in relation to
future/planned work.

I gained a better apprecuiation for statistics and how they relate to and can be used in research. I had no prior knowledge of stats or R before this class and feel much more comfortable reading empirical papers, understanding why certain models were run, and understanding R and its packages. I am currently working on a senior thesis and am using R to analyze and visualize my results!!

<h3>What did you learn from all this?</h3>
<hr />
<p>Please name at least three things you feel you learned in this
course.
I learned about R and how to import and use packages.
I learned about linear regressions and how to use them to fit models and visualize data.
I learned how to make graphs and box plots (my favorite part of the course!)
I was introduced to GitHub and learned how to push and pull my/my peers' repos and work on them remotely (something I introduced to my lab and we work on together now!)
